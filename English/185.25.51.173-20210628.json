There begins garbage that they themselves will not figure out who they are paying there who is not. He said ok and silence. It's just that in all our chats there are people whom we and the professional pay, even at the reverse. I suggest that there was no confusion and it didn\u2019t stick to anyone there by chance (the last time there were a couple of attempts, but I missed it)) - you need to decide Either I pay everyone for the RFP, or let them chat with pentesters where the prof - they themselves pay everyone ."

I proposed to Buz the following scheme:\n\nWe have a separate reconnaissance rocket. there is a group on requests - there hackers are asked to put pressure on or prepare this or that company. we pass it on to analysts, they make a dossier report. if blackmail\\calls is required - we transfer this task to the callers. In order for callers to work effectively and not to call into the air, as it is happening right now - they are in touch with analysts, they can request any additional data from them\nlet's say part of the date listing, or some kind of info about computers \\ passwords\nIf the company does not make contact, its data is transferred further for publication on the site. (to do this, you need to pull up either a reshaev or some of his support in this chat)\n\nthe essence of the problem with calls is such that most often when calling, the caller gets to the reception where some kind of tpshka does not know the situation at all. and in fact we just got you out of nowhere with such a call, you need some kind of proof to get a result, and not just hang up or send calls ..\n\nIn principle, everything is already working, you just need to tune it up and so that hackers start using it. I pulled a gang of dereke, horsa, and I\u2019ll pull the reverse .."

  "body": "According to the professional - I spoke with him, he said that you yourself decide everything there and tell me what to do, as a result, there was no information from you or from him ..\n\nBro, if possible, please pay a little more attention - I try to work on all your Wishlist, and you read everything through the line. and you ended up talking to him about the blockchain. I understand that the social network will be on the blockchain, but the development of the social network also needs coders - here he has them. As for the part of the blockchain, we will look for other people for this .. so, in the end, you didn\u2019t talk to him for that at all, well, or I don\u2019t understand something correctly in the tasks that you set\n\nEbash here day and night on all fronts what you put, I want you to be happy with everything there, I constantly show some kind of initiative, and in the end you answer once a day at best ..\n\nAnd about the fact that he pulled up someone close - well, yes, he pulled it up, through his brother he found the right people to solve your problem. Nobody can do that to you online. And offline, I don\u2019t think that you will find the same frostbitten guys who will agree to risk a normal white company with a good turnover and reputation, and even more than one in the end. I didn\u2019t find it, and no one else would have found it, it\u2019s not for you to buy coke on a hydra, there the private security service works like in the white house. It was just a fucking difficult task, and in the end we put the squeeze on it, bought it. I also promised the guys on my own behalf heifers and a sauna, because it really was, well, not very easy. The same goes for Alka - you set the task of solving her problem. I go out of my way to solve this, since I have good opportunities in this area - but again, this is all offline, through a trusted person in whom I am 100% sure. I perfectly understand that this is at least a thread to me. And I also understand my personal risks. But I do your request as for myself. In general, I try to solve all these very extravagant quests of yours. I worry about the results of the whole team as if they were my own. I get upset when negativity flies at the trick and I try to fix it all, fix it and finalize it .. I save your money like my own, I demand reports from everyone, I bargain with everything, I collect sanctions if there are such people for someone .. Everything is always clear on all financial issues and several times I unsubscribe to you what was spent where and how much, why and why. But I have a clear feeling that you are not interested in all this at all. I'm not an extrasensory. I can't think of your cunning plan and all your wishes for you. Unsubscribe then tasks more precisely. I wrote about offline that I would do it through friends - I wrote this all the time. You didn't say a word. And now you're saying you can't. We also talked about the budget of all these movements more than once - you wrote that ok, 50 60k norms suits you .. And then it turns out that you don\u2019t need it anymore. I am writing that we have people whom we did not take into account earlier - I know that you do not have time for this, I decide the issue with them myself so as not to soar you and not beg for the next 3-5k, I unsubscribe everything to you and write down where and for what was spent - and you don't even remember about it.\nYou constantly make me think that you are not interested in what is happening here, that no matter how hard I try for you, I bring some results - and you fucking remember after 2 days about it .. \"then, tomorrow, yes, ok\" This for you, these are all trifles, but I lived here all my life until I organized and muddied all this. I will be so gray in a year."

  "body": "According to the professional - I spoke with him, he said that you yourself decide everything there and tell me what to do, as a result, there was no information from you or from him ..\n\nBro, if possible, please pay a little more attention - I try to work on all your Wishlist, and you read everything through the line. and you ended up talking to him about the blockchain. I understand that the social network will be on the blockchain, but the development of the social network also needs coders - here he has them. As for the part of the blockchain, we will look for other people for this .. so, in the end, you didn\u2019t talk to him for that at all, well, or I don\u2019t understand something correctly in the tasks that you set\n\nEbash here day and night on all fronts what you put, I want you to be happy with everything there, I constantly show some kind of initiative, and in the end you answer once a day at best ..\n\nAnd about the fact that he pulled up someone close - well, yes, he pulled it up, through his brother he found the right people to solve your problem. Nobody can do that to you online. And offline, I don\u2019t think that you will find the same frostbitten guys who will agree to risk a normal white company with a good turnover and reputation, and even more than one in the end. I didn\u2019t find it, and no one else would have found it, it\u2019s not for you to buy coke on a hydra, there the private security service works like in the white house. It was just a fucking difficult task, and in the end we put the squeeze on it, bought it. I also promised the guys on my own behalf heifers and a sauna, because it really was, well, not very easy. The same goes for Alka - you set the task of solving her problem. I go out of my way to solve this, since I have good opportunities in this area - but again, this is all offline, through a trusted person in whom I am 100% sure. I perfectly understand that this is at least a thread to me. And I also understand my personal risks. But I do your request as for myself. In general, I try to solve all these very extravagant quests of yours. I worry about the results of the whole team as if they were my own. I get upset when negativity flies at the trick and I try to fix it all, fix it and finalize it .. I save your money like my own, I demand reports from everyone, I bargain with everything, I collect sanctions if there are such people for someone .. Everything is always clear on all financial issues and several times I unsubscribe to you what was spent where and how much, why and why. But I have a clear feeling that you are not interested in all this at all. I'm not an extrasensory. I can't think of your cunning plan and all your wishes for you. Unsubscribe then tasks more precisely. I wrote about offline that I would do it through friends - I wrote this all the time. You didn't say a word. And now you're saying you can't. We also talked about the budget of all these movements more than once - you wrote that ok, 50 60k norms suits you .. And then it turns out that you don\u2019t need it anymore. I am writing that we have people whom we did not take into account earlier - I know that you do not have time for this, I decide the issue with them myself so as not to soar you and not beg for the next 3-5k, I unsubscribe everything to you and write down where and for what was spent - and you don't even remember about it.\nYou constantly make me think that you are not interested in what is happening here, that no matter how hard I try for you, I bring some results - and you fucking remember after 2 days about it .. \"then, tomorrow, yes, ok\" This for you, these are all trifles, but I lived here all my life until I organized and muddied all this. I will be so gray-haired in a year."
